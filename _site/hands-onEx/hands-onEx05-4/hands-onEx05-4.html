<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<hr>
<p>Parallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is more common in academic research and scientific analysis, and less commonly used in commercial or public data visualization. For example, it can be used to describe the characteristics of different clusters in Customer Segmentation,. Expert opinion: Stephen Few (2006) pointed out that parallel coordinate plots are mainly used for data analysis rather than conveying information to the public. It is suitable for interactive exploration of data rather than static display.</p>
