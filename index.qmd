**Step by Step: My Journey in Data Analytics and Visualization**

Below is a screenshot from one of my favorite games, [The Forest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242760/The_Forest/). It reminds me of the journey of building a home, one tree at a time, with an axe in hand. Similarly, data analytics and visualization require patience, attention to detail, and steady progress. Every step I take in this course is like cutting down a tree to build a stronger foundation in analytics.
